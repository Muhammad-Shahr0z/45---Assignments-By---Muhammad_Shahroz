// Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.

function carInfomations(
    manufacturer: string,
    modelName: string,
    ...optionalFeature: { [key: string]: any }[]
) {
    const car = {
        manufacturer,
        modelName,
        ...Object.assign({}, ...optionalFeature),
    };
    return car;
}

let CarsInfo = carInfomations(
    "Toyota",
    "corolla",
    { colour: "black" },
    { Special_features: "Bullet proof" },
    { Year: 2025 }
);
console.log(CarsInfo);
